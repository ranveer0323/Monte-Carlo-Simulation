# Importance of Fermi Estimates - Monte Carlo Approach

## Introduction
This project aims to simulate Fermi estimates using a Monte Carlo approach. Fermi estimates are a quick, powerful technique for making calculations based on limited information. By combining Fermi estimates with Monte Carlo simulations, we can understand the impact of uncertainty on the overall estimate.

## Objectives
The main objectives are to:
- Simulate Fermi estimates with varying numbers of steps (n).
- Plot the distribution of estimates, compute mean, standard deviation, and other statistical measures.
- Analyze how error varies as a function of individual step errors.

## Methodology
### Scenario Definition
The scenario is estimating user growth for a startup's mobile app over a year, with factors contributing to growth and uncertainties.

### Simulation Steps
1. User Acquisition Strategies (n1)
2. Market Trends and Industry Insights (n2)
3. User Engagement and Networking Platform (n3)
4. Monetization Strategy and Value Proposition (n4)
5. External Factors and Ecosystem Dynamics (n5)

### Monte Carlo Simulation
Generate random values for each step based on normal distributions.
Calculate overall user growth estimate by multiplying step values.

### Data Visualization
Histogram and kernel density estimate plot to visualize Monte Carlo results.

### Error Analysis
Analyze correlation between individual step errors and overall estimate error.

## Results and Findings
Key findings:
- Mean user growth: 1.73x, Std Dev: 0.66x from 1,000 simulations.
- Most likely growth: 1.5x to 2x.
- Steps with greatest std deviations (user engagement, external factors, user acquisition) contribute most to overall error.
- Correlating step errors helps identify areas needing accurate estimates.

## Conclusion
This project shows the power of Fermi estimates with Monte Carlo simulations in modeling complex scenarios. Breaking down problems and simulating outcomes provides insights into driving factors and uncertainties. Applicable to engineering and business decisions with limited information.
